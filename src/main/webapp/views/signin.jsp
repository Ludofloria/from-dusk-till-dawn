                <h1>From Dusk Till Dawn</h1>

                <p>Welcome to From Dusk Till Dawn, an unaffiliated companion site to <a href="http://www.die2nite.com/">Die2Nite</a></p>
                
                <h2>Die2Nite</h2>

                <p>The game <a href="http://www.die2nite.com/">Die2Nite</a> is nothing short of spectacular in its genre.
                You take on the role of a resident in a post-apocalyptic town surrounded by a huge starving horde of
                undead, hungering for your flesh. Death is all but certain, the only thing you can do is delay it as long as
                possible. But beware, not everyone is as civic as you are and some are definitely set to gain even if it
                costs you.</p>

                <p>Every day the horde grows stronger and every day the danger grows. Prepare to embark on courageous
                journeys, killing zombies in a dance of death, explore long-abandoned ruins, organize the community
                to defend itself, or just plain put yourself at number one. Die2Nite is a social game where death happens
                over and over again. Only the soul remains with your most remarkable accomplishments imbued for all to
                see.</p>

                <p>This site is a companion site to Die2Nite. Players can keep track of data which they cannot maintain
                in the game itself. It helps players to organize what they have found in the World Beyond and it keeps
                players in touch with what is happening around them.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>First make sure that <i>From Dusk Till Dawn</i> has been <a href="#activate_duskdawn">activated</a> for your
                        user account in Die2Nite.
                    </p>
                    <p>Then choose the little computer symbol in the top-left corner. This is known as <b>The Directory</b>. Here you
                        choose <i>From Dusk Till Dawn</i>.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The <b>Update My Zone</b> button is your friend. A good <i>best practice</i> is to press it once on entering
                        a new zone and once again, just before exiting. It takes a bit of practice, but this will get you the best
                        long-term results with regards to quality of data.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="plugins" class="question">
                    <p><img class="question_mark" src="images/landing-page/question-mark.png"/>&nbsp;What's with the Firefox/Chrome plugins?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>From the Die2Nite community has come the initiative to deal with the fact that a number of different Map
                        tools were running at the same time, but not sharing the same master data source. The result is that
                        a town would have to preferably use one tool, or risk difficult coordination of activities. To deal
                        with this, two plugins have been created (one for Firefox and one for Chrome) which automatically
                        update all four major map tools simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/die2nite-agent/">Firefox Plugin</a> has
                        been written by <b>isaaclw</b>.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcbnodoolliadkflmgoebfepeehmelnj">Chrome Plugin</a> has
                        been written by <b>simast</b>.</p>
                    <p>Note that the plugins only take care of the automatic updating of the information that is returned by
                        the Die2Nite XML feed. The plugins do not take into account the specifics for a map application, such
                        as scout peeks and available buildings. Neither do the plugins allow a more fine-grained control of
                        the data in a zone. That said, the plugins are an excellent way for those with little time and/or those
                        in towns with various map apps in use, to keep tabs on their own ventures.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The Die2Nite server has to deal with a lot of load, so the people from Motion Twin have decided to
                        implement the sensible policy to work with caches on their server's side. The consequence of this
                        policy is that information gets refreshed approximately every minute. So to answer your question, wait
                        a bit and refresh your browser window to get the latest information.

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>One hour before and one hour after the attack is the busiest time for Die2Nite. Most things happen
                        during this period and also the American and European continents are both active around these
                        times. Busy, busy, busy. Also for the server.</p>
                    <p>In the past these traffic jam hours have caused significant performance issues for the site. After the
                        hardware upgrade, the performance issues have not reoccured. That said, during these hours the site
                        can be slightly slower than at other times.</p>

                    <p>Yes. It may not always move with the speed that you would like, but, hey, that's a hobby project for you :)
                        There is a thread in the world forum, called <i>From Dusk Till Dawn, aka Duskdawn</i>, where new functionality
                        is proposed and discussed. Be sure to chip in there, if you want something.</p>

                    <p><img class="question_mark" src="images/landing-page/question-mark.png"/>&nbsp;How does <i>From Dusk Till Dawn</i> work?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p><i>From Dusk Till Dawn</i> only works because Motion Twin (the creators of Die2Nite) have enabled their
                        application for external applications.</p>

                    <p>Whenever the application is loaded, or whenever a zone is updated (throught the <b>Update My Zone</b> action),
                    From Dusk Till Dawn places a call to the Die2Nite server to retrieve the latest information. This information is
                    then read and interpreted and used to update the map information.</p>

                    <p>Although <i>From Dusk Till Dawn</i> can read from its own caches, for the longer term, it is dependent
                        on the Die2Nite server for its operation. <b>It cannot exist without access to the Die2Nite server.</b></p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The site runs on a MySQL database. The database is shielded with a Java backend, unlocked by a REST
                        (Amazon-style) interface. The backend stack consists of Spring and JPA/Hibernate and various supporting
                        frameworks. The frontend is pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (mainly JQuery).</p>
                    <p>The platform of the site is run on a VPS by <a href="http://www.xlshosting.nl/">XLS Hosting</a>, a
                        dutch Cloud party with a very seductive VPS offer. The server is equipped with 1 GB internal memory, 2
                        Cores (4.4 GHz), 150 GB bandwidth and a 10 GB harddisk. Currently, about 25% of the harddisk is being
                        utilized. The database already contains millions of records.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Technically speaking, I'm not mad. My reasons for running this site are to keep my programming skills
                        up-to-date with something tangible, something people actually use. I have learned a lot about running
                        a site under considerable load and all the performance tuning that requires. Also, this is a good
                        chance to get some hands-on frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery) knowledge and a refresher
                        for some backend technologies (Java, Spring, JPA/Hibernate, ehcache, Maven, GSon, Log4J, Mysql, HSQLDB,
                        Quartz, SLF4J, JUnit, AspectJ). In my daytime job I program too little, so I need this.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I love to create something that has value for people. Seeing how this site is used and
                        how much it is appreciated is its own reward. Thanks for the trust and encouragement, y'all!</p>
