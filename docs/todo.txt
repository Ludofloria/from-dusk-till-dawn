Line up:
1. Set the options to their default (ie, remove all cookies, read from the cookies and repaint the lot)
2. Original markers (set as option, default: off)
3. Hover over activity rating, showing actual activity (reads/writes)
4. Have another view -> default view gives undiscovered/nvt as they do now; new view makes undiscovered invisible and gives nvt normal zone status with opacity
5. Put in die2nite wiki link to items + hover description
6. Zone activity
7. Show number of items in a zone -- put this in a radio button group with zombie numbers
8. Mark possible buildings
9. Have a green check marker if there is certainty that the zone has recently been updated. Perhaps also do something with when the update took place?
10. Update zone on loading map -- worthwhile?
11. There was a player with a MapMatrix/OOB error (see stickies)
12. Have radar and wind directions up at the same time
13. Have individual wind directions as separate option (idea Dkarba)
14. Preload images
15. Sprite maps for:
    * zone images
16. BUG: Make sure that it is possible to set 0 zombies in undiscovered (check if problem is broader than this)
17. BUG: Updating a zone with upgraded map, makes it rely on the cached XML feed, not on the secure update. Data is saved correctly, however
18. Zombie - range => "1) Inputting a range for zombie count (Scout Sense), ex: 2-4" (Reppin)
19. Persist constructions tab showing materials or not (from Mogman)

"My plans for the moment:
* tagging"

DATABASE
1. Replace bigints with ints wherever possible

Bugs:
* CHECK - couple the keys to cities; when a regular update takes place, read from the city file

Nice to have:
* with upgraded map, disallow adjusting the number of zombies

Persistence
* reuse part of production Spring application context in test environment

Run this on the production database:

create table unique_titles (
  id int not null auto_increment,
  name varchar(80) not null,
  unique_distinction_id int not null,
  treshold double,
  twinoid_points int,
  primary key (id)
) ENGINE=INNODB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
alter table unique_titles add constraint fk_unique_titles_unique_distinctions_unique_distinction_id foreign key (unique_distinction_id) references unique_distinctions(id);
