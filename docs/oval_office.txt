Communication with Oval Office works as follows:

MAIL

1. First a call is made to Duskdawn:

   GET /mail?key=[USER_KEY]

2. A call is then sent to Oval Office to acquire mail information:

   GET http://d2n.sindevel.com/oo/api.php?mode=checkmail&apikey=[SITE_KEY]&userid=[GAME_ID]

   The site key is stored in sitekey.properties with variable name sitekey.oo. Note that this file is not persisted to maintain the security of the keys.
   The game ID is part of the user information: user.getGameId()

3. Oval Office sends back a record with the following layout:

   ?{
     "messages": 0,
     "invitations": 0,
     "userid": 109665,
     "tempkey": "dd6cd6284301703962816e16e21aa77e",
     "valid": 1326038572,
     "oourl": "http://d2n.sindevel.com/oo/?user=109665&tkey=dd6cd6284301703962816e16e21aa77e"
   }

   * messages: number of messages waiting in the OO mailbox

   * valid: until what time (OO server time) the temporary key is valid. 60 minutes.

4. The user sends back the Oval Office information to the caller.
